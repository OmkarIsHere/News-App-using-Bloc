  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
#  assets:
#    - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#    - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Helvetica
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Helvetica.ttf

    - family: Helvetica-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Helvetica-Bold.ttf

    - family: OpenSans-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf

    - family: OpenSans-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf

#    - family: OpenSans-Bold
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
